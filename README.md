## NUMRANGE
Given an array of non negative integers A, and a range (B, C), 
find the number of continuous subsequences in the array which have sum S in the range [B, C] or B <= S <= C

Continuous subsequence is defined as all the numbers A[i], A[i + 1], .... A[j]
where 0 <= i <= j < size(A)

## SUBTRACT
Given a singly linked list, modify the value of first half nodes such that :

1st node’s new value = the last node’s value - first node’s current value
2nd node’s new value = the second last node’s value - 2nd node’s current value,
and so on …
