# C++ Solutions to Coding Challenges

## PRETTYPRINT
Print concentric rectangular pattern in a 2d matrix. 
Let us show you some examples to clarify what we mean.

## NUMRANGE
Given an array of non negative integers A, and a range (B, C), 
find the number of continuous subsequences in the array which have sum S in the range [B, C] or B <= S <= C

Continuous subsequence is defined as all the numbers A[i], A[i + 1], .... A[j]
where 0 <= i <= j < size(A)

## SUBTRACT
Given a singly linked list, modify the value of first half nodes such that :

1st node’s new value = the last node’s value - first node’s current value
2nd node’s new value = the second last node’s value - 2nd node’s current value,
and so on …

## Minimum Characters required to make a String Palindromic
You are given a string. The only operation allowed is to insert characters in the beginning of the string. 
How many minimum characters are needed to be inserted to make the string a palindrome string

## Length of Last Word
Given a string s consists of upper/lower-case alphabets and empty space characters ' ', return the length of last word in the string.
If the last word does not exist, return 0.

## Noble Integer
Given an integer array, find if an integer p exists in the array such that the number of integers greater than p in the array equals to p.
If such an integer is found return 1 else return -1.
